                    Copa America 2021</h1>
                <p class="over-flow box">Copa America 2021 is over, and Argentina is the queen of South America
                    after 28 years, with Messi
                    finally winning his first international title. It was a long journey with 4 group matches and three
                    knock-out matches. But let’s overview how the tournament went. After rejecting the invitation from
                    CONMEBOL, Qatar and Australia forced the competition to be formed of two groups of 5 teams each.
                    Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Uruguay were in Group A. The first round saw Argentina
                    against Chile. Leo Messi scored from an outrageous free-kick, and then Chile equalized with Vargas
                    after the rebound of the missed penalty from Vidal (1-1). It was not the start that Argentina would
                    want, but they immediately got back stronger with three wins in the second, third, and fifth rounds.
                    1-0 against both Uruguay and Paraguay, with goals from Guido Rodriguez and Alejandro Gomez,
                    respectively. The last game saw Argentina take on the last place of group A, Bolivia. They went
                    running riots, winning 4-1 with Lionel Messi being the Man of the match with two goals. The
                    scoresheet also appeared for the first time in the event ‘El Toro’ Lautaro Martinez and Alejandro
                    Gomez with the second goal in Copa America 2021. Uruguay, another contender for the cup, lost
                    against Argentina 1-0 in round 2, took one point after being behind in a final 1-1 draw vs. Chile
                    with Luis Suárez responding to Edu Vargas. After 1 point in two games, Uruguay managed to win the
                    two other matches 0-2 versus Bolivia with the help of an own goal and Edinson Cavani. The last round
                    saw them against Paraguay, and the result was 1-0 for La Celeste with a penalty goal from Cavani.
                    Chile secured a 1-0 win versus Bolivia after drawing 1-1 against Argentina in the first match, with
                    Brereton being the hero of the three points. Another 1-1 draw against Uruguay closed their group
                    campaign with a 2-0 loss against Paraguay, Samudio, and a penalty from Almiron caused the defeat.
                    Paraguay started the competition with a 3-1 win with Bolivia. A great second-half comeback with Kaku
                    and Romero twice made the penalty converted in goal in the first half from Saavedra useless. Bolivia
                    is the last-placed team in group A with 0 points losing against all their opponents. 3-1 vs.
                    Paraguay, 1-0 vs. Chile, 2-0 vs. Uruguay, and 4-1 vs. Argentina Made Bolivia the worst team of Copa
                    America 2021. The final standing of this group saw Argentina on top with 10 points, Uruguay with 7,
                    Paraguay with 6, Chile 5, and Bolivia 0.

                    Group B was composted by the home team Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and Ecuador. The first
                    round saw Brazil vs. Venezuela and Colombia vs. Ecuador. Brazil showed they are the number one
                    contenders of this group and the whole competition with a 3-0 win with Marquinhos, Neymar with a
                    penalty, and Gabriel Barbosa on the scoresheet. Los Cafeteros, on the other hand, won 1-0 against
                    Ecuador with the help of Cardona. The second round saw Brazil showing no mercy against Peru, winning
                    4-0 with Alex Sandro, Neymar, Richarlison, and Ribeiro. Colombia, with a win against Ecuador, a draw
                    against Venezuela, and two losses against Brazil and Peru, ranked 3rd in Group B.

                    Venezuela vs. Ecuador was the other match of round 3, ending in a spectacular 2-2 draw, with
                    Hernandez equalizing, in the end, to rescue a point for Venezuela and keeping their hopes alive.
                    Brazil showed power and composure against Colombia, coming back from behind to win the game in the
                    100th minute(90+10) with the goal from Casemiro. Diaz scored a fantastic goal in the first half,
                    then Firmino equalized in the 78th minute. Peru took a precious point against Ecuador, coming back
                    from 2-0 down to equalize in just five minutes (49 and 54 of the second half), with Lapadula and
                    Carrillo responding to the own goal from Tapia and Preciado. After securing the qualification and
                    the first place, Brazil made some of their best players rest and took a 1-1 draw against Ecuador.
                    Militao scored first in the first half, then Mena scored the equalizing goal. Venezuela vs. Peru was
                    a very important match for both of them, seeing that it was played for the qualification to the
                    quarters. A goal from Carrilo at the beginning of the second half made Peru win 1-0 and go through
                    to the next phase, letting Venezuela the last in group B. The final standings for this group saw
                    Brazil in first place with 10 points, Peru 7, Colombia 4, Ecuador 3, and Venezuela 2 points.

                    The quarters were Argentina vs. Ecuador, Uruguay vs. Colombia, Brazil vs. Chile, and Peru vs.
                    Paraguay. Another show from Argentina where another Messi free-kick goal, De Paul and Martinez, put
                    Argentina in the semis. Brazil managed a 1-0 win against Chile with ten men for more than 40 minutes
                    with Paqueta’s goal and defended the advantage till the end. The two other matches ended in a draw,
                    and penalties decided the semifinalists. Uruguay vs. Colombia ended in a goalless draw, but Colombia
                    got the best out of penalties, winning 4-2, booking a semifinal ticket versus Argentina. Paraguay
                    vs. Peru was one of the most exciting matches of this tournament as they ended in a 3-3 draw with
                    emotions till the last minute. Peru won the shootout 4-3 after 12 penalties. Brazil v Peru and
                    Argentina v Colombia to secure the big final. Another 1-0 for “Selecao” was enough to go to the
                    mighty Maracana and fight for the trophy. Argentina started the semis very well with an early goal
                    from Martinez, but Colombia equalized, and the result didn’t change until the end. In the penalty
                    shootouts, Argentina’s hero was their Goalkeeper Martinez with three fantastic saves for the final
                    result in penalties 3-2. Peru v Colombia was the final for the third place, finished 3-2 in the last
                    minute with Diaz scoring a great goal and giving Colombia the third place of the Copa America. The
                    grand final then was between Argentina and Brazil. In a legendary stadium like Maracana, the classic
                    match saw Argentina win 1-0 with a chip goal from Di Maria in the middle of the first half. That
                    goal seemed to be enough as Argentina managed to defend their goal till the end. The full-time
                    whistle saw all the players hugging Messi, knowing what that trophy means to him. A truly deserved
                    trophy for him after a fantastic career that one of the best of this sport has had. Messi was
                    selected as the player of the tournament along with Neymar, the top assist provider and the top
                    scorer. The best goalkeeper was Martinez from Argentina. Well-deserved after amazing saves from him.
                    For the best goals, we have to say two free-kick goals from Messi against Chile and Ecuador and the
                    amazing overhead goal of Diaz versus Brazil. It has been a fantastic tournament with great moments,
                    and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. </p>
